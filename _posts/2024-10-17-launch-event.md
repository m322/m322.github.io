Yesterday I attended the launch of the course: a 1-hour zoom call, led by [Adam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/domdomegg/).

It began with a brief overview of why [BlueDot Impact](https://bluedot.org/) organizes this course and a few numbers: 1,500+ applications and 400+ admissions!

Then it was time to meet a few fellow students, with breakrooms created for 2 attendees chosen at random and 10 minutes to introduce ourselves, the reason we applied to the course, and what we expect to get out of it. After coming back to the main room, rinse and repeat!
 
I had lovely chats with people from Greece, the US, Nepal, and Germany. I shared my feeling of going through the `introductions` channel on Slack and being at the same time amazed, impressed, and a bit overwhelmed since most of the participants seem to either have a PhD in AI/robotics/physics/math or working for a FAANG! As it turns out, I'm not the only one thinking that :sweat_smile:

Another interesting insight was how much we could possibly achieve with the final project during the last 4 weeks of the course. My educated guess is:
* given the outstanding attendances, I'm sure there will be incredible projects with Minimum Viable Products or even more!
* personally, I hope to find a project that is interesting, challenging and that can benefit from my own skills. I see the project, and the course as a whole, as a starting point rather than a finish line.

As a final bonus, my latest chat was with [Joshua](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-landes12/), the Community Manager of [BlueDot Impact](https://bluedot.org/): he recommended to lower the entry barrier for reaching out because people love to help when it comes to something they care. Duly noted :thumbsup:
